-- Development stories
('boeing-747-400', 'development', 1965, 'The Legendary Handshake Deal',
'The 747 was born from a legendary conversation between Boeing President William Allen and Pan Am President Juan Trippe. Trippe asked: "If you build it, I''ll buy it." Allen replied: "If you buy it, I''ll build it." This handshake deal launched the most ambitious commercial aircraft program in history, with Pan Am ordering 25 aircraft for $525 million.',

('boeing-747-400', 'development', 1966, 'Boeing Bet the Company',
'Boeing literally bet the company on the 747 program. The $1 billion development cost (equivalent to over $9 billion today) exceeded the company''s entire net worth. If the program had failed, Boeing would have gone bankrupt. The company had to build the world''s largest building in Everett, Washington just to assemble the aircraft.',

('boeing-747-400', 'story', 1966, 'The Hump That Changed Everything',
'Juan Trippe originally wanted a full double-deck design, but concerns about emergency evacuation led to the wide-body single-deck configuration. The distinctive "hump" behind the cockpit was initially added for aerodynamic streamlining, but Trippe suggested using it for a passenger lounge. This created the iconic silhouette that defined the Queen of the Skies.',

('boeing-747-400', 'milestone', 1968, 'Rollout of the First Jumbo Jet',
'On September 30, 1968, the first 747 was rolled out of the custom-built Everett Plant, the world''s largest building by volume. The aircraft was so large that spectators gasped when they first saw it. It was longer than the Wright Brothers'' first flight, wider than a boulevard, and its tail was as tall as a six-story building.',

('boeing-747-400', 'milestone', 1969, 'First Flight of the Queen',
'On February 9, 1969, the Boeing 747 took to the skies for the first time from Paine Field in Everett, Washington. Test pilots Jack Waddell, Brien Wygle, and flight engineer Jess Wallick flew the aircraft for just over an hour. The flight was cut slightly short due to a minor flap issue, but the era of the jumbo jet had begun.',

('boeing-747-400', 'milestone', 1970, 'Pan Am Launches the Jumbo Jet Era',
'On January 22, 1970, Pan Am''s 747 "Clipper Young America" flew the first commercial 747 service from New York to London. The era of mass air travel had truly arrived. The 747 could carry more than twice as many passengers as the 707, dramatically reducing the cost per seat and making international travel accessible to millions.',

('boeing-747-400', 'milestone', 2023, 'End of an Era: The Final 747',
'On January 31, 2023, the final Boeing 747 was delivered to Atlas Air, ending 54 years of continuous production. A total of 1,574 aircraft were built. The "Queen of the Skies" revolutionized air travel, but fuel-efficient twin-engine aircraft ultimately made the four-engine jumbo economically obsolete for most routes.',

('airbus-a380', 'development', 1993, 'The Joint Venture That Never Was',
'In 1993, Airbus and Boeing briefly considered joining forces to develop a new superjumbo together. They studied the market potential but reached different conclusions. Boeing believed the future was in smaller, point-to-point aircraft. Airbus bet on bigger planes for hub airports. The joint venture collapsed, and both companies pursued their visions separately.',

('airbus-a380', 'development', 2000, 'Why It''s Called the A380',

('airbus-a380', 'story', 2006, 'The Wiring Nightmare',
'The A380 program suffered a devastating setback when engineers discovered that cables inside the fuselage were too short. The problem: different Airbus facilities across Europe had used incompatible versions of their design software. The fix required 530 kilometers of wiring to be rerouted by hand, delaying deliveries by two years and nearly doubling development costs to €25 billion.',

('airbus-a380', 'milestone', 2019, 'The End Announced',
'On February 14, 2019—ironically, Valentine''s Day—Airbus announced it would end A380 production after Emirates reduced its order. The superjumbo dream was over. Only 251 aircraft would be built, far short of the 750 needed to break even.',

'The A380 never recovered its €25 billion development cost and is widely considered a commercial failure. Yet it remains a remarkable engineering achievement—the largest passenger aircraft ever built, beloved by passengers for its quiet, spacious cabins.

-- Development stories
('boeing-787-9', 'development', 2001, 'The Sonic Cruiser Dream',
'Before the 787, Boeing planned the revolutionary Sonic Cruiser—a near-supersonic jet that would fly just below the speed of sound. But after 9/11 devastated the airline industry and fuel prices soared, airlines told Boeing they wanted efficiency, not speed. The Sonic Cruiser died, but its technology lived on in the Dreamliner.',

('boeing-787-9', 'development', 2003, 'Birth of the Dreamliner',
'On January 29, 2003, Boeing announced the 7E7, focusing on fuel efficiency rather than speed. The aircraft would use revolutionary composite materials for 50% of its structure—including the first one-piece composite fuselage barrel in commercial aviation. Airlines loved the promise of 20% better fuel efficiency.',
'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_787_Dreamliner', 'Wikipedia'),

('boeing-787-9', 'story', 2007, 'The Outsourcing Experiment Gone Wrong',
'Boeing tried a revolutionary approach: outsource major components to partners worldwide, then snap them together like Lego. It was a disaster. Parts arrived late, incomplete, or didn''t fit together. Some sections arrived with tools still inside. The first aircraft was 5,000 pounds overweight. What was supposed to be a 4-year development stretched to 8 years.',

('boeing-787-9', 'story', NULL, 'Why Passengers Love It',
'The 787 was designed around passenger comfort, not just airline economics. Larger windows that dim electronically, higher cabin pressure (equivalent to 6,000 feet instead of 8,000), and higher humidity all reduce jet lag. Passengers consistently report arriving feeling better than on other aircraft.',

'On January 7, 2013, a Japan Airlines 787 caught fire at Boston''s Logan Airport due to a lithium-ion battery thermal runaway. Nine days later, an ANA 787 made an emergency landing with smoke in the cockpit. The FAA grounded all 787s worldwide—the first such grounding since 1979. Boeing redesigned the battery system, and the fleet returned to service in April 2013.',

-- Legacy
('boeing-787-9', 'legacy', NULL, 'The Plane That Changed Everything',
'The 787 proved that composite aircraft could work at scale, paving the way for the A350 and future designs. Its efficiency opened new ultra-long-haul routes that were previously uneconomical. Over 1,000 have been delivered, connecting cities that never had direct flights before.',
