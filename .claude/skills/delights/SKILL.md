# Delights

The little things that make someone pause and think "oh, that's nice." Not hidden — front and center. Craft that shows someone cared.

Think: motion, color, interactions, sound, transitions, personality. The stuff that turns a functional site into one people remember.

## What We Have

- **Mario pixel clouds** — Animated pixel cloud shader across all page headers
- **Console messages** — ASCII art in dev tools
- **Smooth hover transitions** — Cards scale and shadow on hover
- **Image lazy loading** — Progressive reveal as you scroll

---

## Ideas

### Interactions

- **Contrail cursor** — Cursor leaves a fading white trail on aircraft pages
- **Engine sound on hover** — Faint turbine whir when hovering over aircraft cards
- **Takeoff animation** — Aircraft image tilts up slightly on page enter
- **Altitude counter** — Scroll position displayed as "altitude" in the corner

### Personality

- **Runway 404** — Dead page shows a runway with "Flight not found" and taxiway signs
- **Time-aware theme** — Slightly different sky colors for day/night based on local time
- **Loading states with personality** — "Taxiing to runway..." instead of a spinner
- **Empty states with charm** — "No aircraft spotted here... yet" instead of "No results"

### Motion

- **Card entrance animations** — Aircraft fade/slide in as you scroll down
- **Parallax clouds** — Header clouds shift slightly on scroll
- **Hover micro-animations** — Manufacturer logos wobble, specs counter ticks up

### Sound

- **Ambient airport** — Optional faint background hum on atmospheric pages
- **Interaction feedback** — Subtle click sounds on navigation

## Principles

- **Noticed, not announced** — No tooltips explaining the delight. People discover it.
- **Enhances, never blocks** — Animations and effects never slow down the core experience.
- **Consistent mood** — Every detail should feel like it belongs in the same aviation world.
- **Accessible** — Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. Sound is always optional.
- **Layered** — First visit you notice one thing. Third visit you notice another.
